To form a level, take one photo from level 7, 
then pick others from corresonding level folder.

Each level folder contains a large number of photos for randomization.

Level 7 is the target photo level. Level 0 - 6 are company photos. 
The levels of a group of faces are sorted based on similarity with Level 7 group.
The similarity score increases with level goes higher.

The step similarity score risen for every level upgrade is not under consideration yet.
