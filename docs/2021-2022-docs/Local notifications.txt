Notification Implimentation lives in front-end\src\app\dashboard\dashboard.page.ts

It is set to remind user once everyday and it uses a custom sound made by team 3.

    this.localNotifications.schedule({
      title: 'Remember to do your training!',
      text: 'You have not done your training today, for better results we recommend you do 10 minutes of training every day!',
      sound: 'file://assets/sounds/notification.mp3',
      trigger: { every: { hour: 17, minute: 28 } }
    });
